In this context, the work done is a form of applied research. Alternatively, in an academic setting, the objective may be broader, such as proposing a concept or an idea for students to visually investigate and respond to. In this context, the work done is a form of pure research. In either case, the terminology may differ, and the distinctions between different stages of the process may be more or less defined. Any design brief can be broken down into three specific questions: the field of study or project background, the focus of the project (often called the research question), and the research methodology.</p><p>The field of study (where the work will be situated, what exists in relation to the research question, and what role the outcome will play). Does the result achieve what was intended? Describe the context of the work. This could be the field of information design for wayfinding and signage, or the layout of magazine pages for a specific audience. First, the designer must research their field of study to gain knowledge of what already exists in this area and the range of visual language.</p><h3 id="designers-need-to-consider-both-external-and-internal-factors" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#designers-need-to-consider-both-external-and-internal-factors"><span>Designers Need to Consider Both External and Internal Factors</span></a></h3><p>It is crucial for designers to consider both the external location of a visual communication piece (i.e., the clear purpose of the piece itself) and the internal location (i.e., the relationship of the piece to other works within the same context). This is important because contemporary culture is saturated with advertising, infographics, visual identities for specific websites, and images related to entertainment or decoration. If a visual communication piece is to be displayed in this field, the designer needs to be aware of its relationship to competing messages and how to address issues of image saturation or information overload to effectively convey the message.</p><p>Of course, designers will become more familiar with a particular field of study through professional experience. By establishing relationships with specific clients, designers can understand which communication methods are more likely (or less) to succeed based on the field of study. Then, accumulated knowledge becomes more intuitive based on previous experience, and designers can more quickly pivot to appropriate project focuses and methodologies.</p><p>Selecting a research model involves various forms of research within a field, depending on the purpose of the proposed work. Market research methods, such as an intensive visual audit of materials, may be suitable for certain briefs, through which designers look for other works in the same field and analyze and compare readable visual communication forms related to a specific audience.</p><p>This may involve reviewing comparative products or visual systems, working with clients to establish their position in the market or their desire to communicate with a specific audience. In most cases, a complex visual language already exists, trying to attract these audiences, and designers should be familiar with their vocabulary, even if their intention is to create a new form of communication that stands in opposition to existing forms (i.e., the so-called innovative or creative solution).</p><h3 id="project-focus" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#project-focus"><span>Project Focus</span></a></h3><p>Once the field of study has been identified and extensively analyzed, the next stage in the design process is to determine the project focus—what is the specific context and function of the work within the broader field of study that has been defined?—and the research question (a refinement or redefinition of the original intent, or a hypothesis or proposition to test).</p><p>Once the designer is familiar with the broader intent of the brief, a specific project research question is needed to define the exact intent of the work to be carried out. At this stage, the designer should be able to describe the message to be conveyed to a specific audience or context, as well as the purpose and objectives of this communication. For example, persuading the recipient of the message to act in a specific way (e.g., buy this product, attend this event, turn left at the next intersection), or clearly conveying a specific emotion or identification with a subcultural group.</p><p>The focus and specific research question may change over the life of the project, becoming broader and then being redefined in an ongoing process of critical reflection and reassessment. There are many methods for narrowing and refining the project focus.</p><p>The first research model, which we call the &quot;context definition&quot; model, emphasizes the investigation of a field of study. In this model, the designer attempts to become an expert in the field of the brief and defines the project focus in response to identifiable needs within that field. The second model, called &quot;context experimentation,&quot; still requires the designer to conduct an extensive preliminary analysis of the field of study, but the actual work begins at an earlier stage. This is usually done through a series of tests or experiments that can be evaluated within the field of study, allowing the research question to be redefined based on the results collected.</p><p>It is important for the designer not to lose sight of the initial project and intent and to systematically complete their experiments. The experimental model will inevitably lead to many &quot;failed&quot; experimental results because each small &quot;test&quot; is an attempt to gain feedback in the definition of the project focus. In fact, if an experimental visual communication piece does not succeed when tested with the target audience or in a specific context, it should still be considered a positive exercise in gathering information about the project focus and determining direction, reducing the potential for further development. By identifying what does not work and what might not work, the designer can better find more successful solutions.</p><h3 id="action-plan" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#action-plan"><span>Action Plan</span></a></h3><p>Once the problem has been identified, the next step is to choose the appropriate research methodology (how will the designer study and develop the project in response to the context and intent?). Research methodology is simply a set of self-imposed rules that the designer will follow to engage with or participate in the project or brief. Once the intent of the work is clear, along with a detailed mapping of the field of study and a defined focus and research question, the designer needs to outline how he or she intends to approach the development of the project and test ideas to create an effective solution for the brief—an action plan.</p><p>The intention here is to develop a more successful systematic approach to work gradually, based on experiments and visual tests, material investigations, and audience feedback, with the goal of producing effective, useful, or engaging graphic design pieces.</p><p><strong>Feedback and Evaluation</strong></p><p>To verify or modify proposed hypotheses, a series of visual tests or design experiments may be conducted to collect feedback on new ideas and forms of communication as the designer works on creating a piece. Employing a range of robust and appropriate research methods should help the designer justify the approach used in their work and can anticipate getting closer to this goal. It is also important to plan the work in advance, including a rough timeline, determining when the designer wants to carry out each experiment and the deadline for completing the project. Deadlines are usually part of the task, whether in the field of commercial graphic design or design research. Even if not, such as when the designer is conducting personal visual research, planning a time frame for the project is still important.</p><p>However, experiments themselves are not perfect. On their own, they must operate under a set of precise guidelines that define the intent and context of the experiment, as well as the way feedback is collected and results are measured. In the design hypothesis, it may be assumed that creating a specific visual form will convey a specific message to a given audience. The experiment to test this hypothesis will involve creating variants of that form and collecting feedback from the target audience or experts in a specific design field to measure the relative success or failure of the piece in terms of intended communication.</p><p>At this point, it is important to consider another key issue: understanding these factors is also important. The difference between quantitative and qualitative methods. Designers often use both forms of analysis, and their application will more or less prove to be helpful depending on the brevity of the audience and the different target audiences. However, how do we measure the results or quantify our findings? When conducting a series of &quot;experiments,&quot; alternative visual strategies may be tested for a defined problem. What is the answer?</p><p>The designer must begin to collect feedback in order to evaluate which methods themselves are distinctly different. Which visual applications are more successful? There are many methods for quantitative analysis based on mathematical principles, especially statistical answers to these questions through surveys and inquiries. Methods. By creating some visual forms for testing, market research, especially related to product advertising and marketing, has developed some ways to &quot;count&quot; the positive and negative reactions of the target audience.</p><p>This may mean using multiple-choice surveys, testing materials and forms of success. Some of these techniques can be scored according to a set of standards. Then, the data collected can be converted into numbers and statistically analyzed, linked to the study of human interaction in anthropological and social groups, while other techniques originate from more scientific data collection and quantitative analysis methods. To find the most successful visual form.</p><p>Designers are first artists, then (or third) communicators. This idea is strange from the beginning, but it provides fewer returns in the long run. Although personality often plays a key role in visual communication, it must be the result of solving design problems, not the goal.</p><p>Of course, as the scale of the survey group or sample increases, we expect the results to become more accurate conservatively neutral, wrongly representing resistance to the old.</p><h3 id="counting-costs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#counting-costs"><span>Counting Costs</span></a></h3><p>However, if the survey question is not strictly controlled or specific enough, the results may also become unclear. People&#39;s reactions to the question are not uniform with the results collected in a scientific experiment, and reactions to visual information (&quot;I like it&quot; vs. &quot;I really like it&quot;) cannot be</p>',27),s=[a];function r(c,d){return i(),t("div",null,s)}const l=e(n,[["render",r],["__file","20240712The primary task of a designer is to identify.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/posts/design%20theory/20240712The%20primary%20task%20of%20a%20designer%20is%20to%20identify.html","title":"","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"##designer Identify In commercial practice, this may be described in a brief as the message to be conveyed, or the target market that a business enterprise wishes to reach.
