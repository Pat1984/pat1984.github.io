This important aspect of graphic design practice encompasses a wide range of practical and theoretical applications. This chapter introduces the field of research methods as an analytical and practical tool for graphic designers.</p><p>By investigating these two research fields in parallel, we aim to establish the role of critical thinking in supporting the development of design practice, which can be described as a form of participatory design practice. Research is an intrinsic aspect of design practice and a fundamental part of problem-solving activities. Designers are always in the process of continuous inquiry. This process can be said to be based on the concept of questioning - whether it leads to discrete results or solutions (such as industrial prototypes based on client needs) or contributions in the form of discussions and debates on propositions or further issues.</p><p>The main theoretical models of design analysis and visual research will also be introduced, including semiotics, communication theory, systematic design problem-solving methods, semantics, rhetoric, and discourse theory, as well as secondary research models and tests of ideas and methods. The underlying emphasis throughout this book is on why we do what we do and how to ensure its effectiveness in the process of visual communication through testing, feedback, and rigorous methods.</p><h3 id="problematizing-design" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#problematizing-design"><span>Problematizing Design</span></a></h3><p>The discipline of graphic design can be defined in various ways - the most enduring definition in its relatively short history describes visual communication as a problem-solving activity. This phrase, to some extent, a slogan for a large part of the design community, has been used to describe the function of graphic design in a commercial sense - a brief description that can be understood by design commissioners (i.e., clients).</p><p>This definition not only legitimizes the commercial and business aspects of design but also leads to a limited description of the function of graphic design, often excluding the broader social, educational, and informational roles that the profession might be seen to have. A broader interpretation of the term &quot;problem-solving&quot; can be described as an analytical and synthetic process.</p><p>Analysis is related to investigative methods, understanding the core of the research project brief, concept, or specific context. Synthesis is the means by which designers use the initial analytical work and investigation to produce meaningful solutions or interventions. This ability is based on the individual designer&#39;s intent and understanding of a series of interrelated issues affecting the creation of successful graphic solutions: audience, message or product, budget, materials, production methods, appropriate visual language, and the form of the final outcome.</p><h3 id="process-and-product" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#process-and-product"><span>Process and Product</span></a></h3><p>The South American design educator and writer Jorge Frascara once wrote: &quot;The design of design methods and the design of research methods are higher-level tasks than communication design.&quot; This statement indicates a key shift in design thinking in recent years. The expansion of the definition of graphic design practice, which is considered an extended definition, has been influenced by factors at a higher level than technology. Speculative and more experimental work at the edge of contemporary graphic design, an area that can be called the field of self-empowered designer work, also has a strong influence.</p><p>These initiatives often provide new visual syntax and graphic forms and can focus on areas of graphic design that were previously restricted and not fully explored in a single commercial context. This recent focus on the processes and methods involved in graphic design reflects a conscious reflection on the way and reasons for practice, giving the field of research methods greater significance to the discipline.</p><p>Discussions on graphic design in university design departments, art schools, and design journals now usually include references to a range of different issues, including the designer&#39;s responsibilities at the social, cultural, and economic levels, as well as responsibilities in constructing language and visual language meaning. This broader field of operation has increased the exploration of ongoing processes and expanded the scope of graphic design research, both in academia and the professional field.</p><h3 id="primary-research" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#primary-research"><span>Primary Research</span></a></h3><p>Research directly related to the original material. Primary research methods may include marketing strategies, such as audience surveys or interviews, or direct testing of potential visual solutions in a &quot;real-world&quot; context.</p><h3 id="secondary-research" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#secondary-research"><span>Secondary Research</span></a></h3><p>Research that has already been conducted and used to support the designer&#39;s own research. This may include published surveys and/or interviews with potential audience groups, as well as various analyses of visual communication strategies conducted in similar contexts.</p><h3 id="tertiary-research" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tertiary-research"><span>Tertiary Research</span></a></h3><p>Research based on secondary materials and research conducted by others, synthesizing and simply reiterating the research carried out by others. A summary of the existing body of knowledge and recognized methods, involving the scope of project intent, audience, and context.</p><h3 id="design-critics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#design-critics"><span>Design Critics</span></a></h3><p>In the broader community, the discussion of graphic design as an activity and its status is left to critics, not those who create it. While this itself provides a useful tool for understanding graphic design, few of these voices come from the practice itself. Journalists, historians, and cultural theorists, rather than those engaged in the &quot;practitioners&quot; - the concept of graphic design by designers - do this in terms of its effects in the social or cultural context, as well as its intent and conceptual approach in the design problem-solving process. Graphic design publications have sprung up like mushrooms, all of which provide insights to varying degrees, focusing on process and intent. However, the intent and conceptual approach of graphic design are often neglected in print and general discussions. At the same time, educational programs and practitioners begin to build graphic design discourse on this basis, and in the process, expand the definition of graphic design practice itself.</p><h3 id="major-shifts-in-contemporary-graphic-design-methods" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#major-shifts-in-contemporary-graphic-design-methods"><span>Major Shifts in Contemporary Graphic Design Methods</span></a></h3><p>Due to discussions around the concept of authorship in graphic design, the scope of contemporary graphic design methods has undergone significant changes, which may determine the role of graphic designers in the future. Although the definition of authorship in graphic design continues to be expanded and updated by designers, design writers, and educators, considering a single interpretation as a starting point for further discussion is useful.</p><p>Traditionally, graphic designers have been involved in a facilitation process: simply put, the work of design is to convey information from others to a specific audience - responding to tasks initiated and defined by clients. This may be to provide general information (such as train schedules or road signs), or to persuade the target audience to pay attention to a specific product through its packaging and promotional design. Although this may be a rough definition, it obviously applies to the vast majority of design practices in the commercial field: graphic designers are commissioned as communicators serving clients.</p><p>The concept of authorship lies in the possibility that designers can also be intermediaries - they can be responsible for the content and context of the information, not just the more traditional means of communication.</p><p>The authorship of graphic design can also play a role when clients present to potential investors in commercial cases. Clients may choose to hire a graphic designer because they have a specific visual style or working method that complements their information or product. This can be described as the designer&#39;s relationship with a specific audience through their work.</p><h3 id="key-concept-rhetoric" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-concept-rhetoric"><span>Key Concept: Rhetoric</span></a></h3><p>Rhetoric, commonly applied in literature and philosophy, refers to the strategic use of language as the basis for rational debate. Classical rhetoric involves many different stages, and in relation to visual communication design, it can be described as: discovering ideas, arranging ideas, styling the treatment of ideas, and the way of presenting themes. These directly correspond to graphic design methods such as concept, composition, style, and format. Antithesis - placing contrasting terms together to emphasize their differences. Graphic designers may use contrasting image information to produce dramatic effects. Metonymy - replacing one word or phrase with another that is closely related to it. An image or name can be replaced by a symbol that contains similar connotations, for example: a crown representing monarchy. Puns, witticisms, or double entendres, using semantic ambiguity to produce humorous effects. Designers may deliberately choose to use an image or symbol that contains multiple direct meanings or references as a simple, light-hearted visual pun. Rhetoric traditionally includes a range of rhetorical devices, including irony, antithesis, metonymy, metaphor, puns, hyperbole, personification, and exaggeration. Comparing some of these strategies with similar methods used in visual communication is useful in order to differentiate approaches and propose alternative methods for exploration.</p><p>Rhetorical terms used in graphic design may include: Metaphor - a word or phrase is applied to an object or action that it does not denote, to imply a certain characteristic. Designers may deliberately use the connotative range of a logo or symbol to enhance a particular value. Irony - a sign is used to convey the opposite meaning or to convey a contradiction. Humor may often be used to suggest irony, sarcasm, or a contradictory position, with visual elements used to emphasize potential tensions or inconsistencies with which the audience is already familiar. Personification - attributing human characteristics and traits to animals or inanimate objects. Exaggeration - an overstatement made for emphasis or dramatic effect. This may apply to the relative scale of type and image.</p>',30),o=[n];function r(c,h){return t(),i("div",null,o)}const l=e(s,[["render",r],["__file","20240711Ian Noble's theory overview.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/posts/stable%20diffusiion%20overview%20and%20design%20theory/20240711Ian%20Noble's%20theory%20overview.html","title":"","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"##WHY AND HOW Graphic Design Research Methods are broadly divided into the following categories: Semiotics Analysis Communication Theory Systematic Approaches Semantics and Disc...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://pat1984.github.io/posts/stable%20diffusiion%20overview%20and%20design%20theory/20240711Ian%20Noble's%20theory%20overview.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Patience Hong"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"##WHY AND HOW Graphic Design Research Methods are broadly divided into the following categories: Semiotics Analysis Communication Theory Systematic Approaches Semantics and Disc..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"Patience Hong"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-08-06T06:57:04.611Z"}],["meta",{"property":"og:modified_time","content":"2024-08-06T06:57:04.611Z"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"##WHY AND HOW Graphic Design Research Methods are broadly divided into the following categories: Semiotics Analysis Communication Theory Systematic Approaches Semantics and Disc..."}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:site","content":"Patience in Sirus"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"Patience in Sirus"}],["meta",{"name":"share_config","content":"twitter,weibo,facebook,email"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Patience Hong\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":3,"title":"Research Methods","slug":"research-methods","link":"#research-methods","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Problematizing Design","slug":"problematizing-design","link":"#problematizing-design","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Process and Product","slug":"process-and-product","link":"#process-and-product","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Primary Research","slug":"primary-research","link":"#primary-research","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Secondary Research","slug":"secondary-research","link":"#secondary-research","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Tertiary Research","slug":"tertiary-research","link":"#tertiary-research","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Design Critics","slug":"design-critics","link":"#design-critics","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Major Shifts in Contemporary Graphic Design Methods","slug":"major-shifts-in-contemporary-graphic-design-methods","link":"#major-shifts-in-contemporary-graphic-design-methods","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Key Concept: Rhetoric","slug":"key-concept-rhetoric","link":"#key-concept-rhetoric","children":[]}],"git":{},"filePathRelative":"posts/stable diffusiion overview and design theory/20240711Ian Noble's theory overview.md","autoDesc":true,"excerpt":"<p>##WHY AND HOW\\nGraphic Design Research Methods are broadly divided into the following categories:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Semiotics</li>\\n<li>Analysis</li>\\n<li>Communication Theory</li>\\n<li>Systematic Approaches</li>\\n<li>Semantics and Discourse Theory</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>Research Methods</h3>\\n<p>The following introduces the field of research methods for graphic designers.
